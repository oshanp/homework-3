Target Heart-Rate Calculator
While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range
suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA)
(www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736) the formula for calculating your maximum
heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is 50-85% of your
maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target
hear rates may vary based on the health, fitness, and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician
or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]
